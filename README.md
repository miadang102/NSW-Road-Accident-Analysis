# NSW-Road-Accident-Analysis
The project aims to address the rising road fatalities in Australia, focusing on New South Wales (NSW). With a grim road safety scenario in most regions, Transport for NSW has enlisted our expertise to analyze the provided NSW Road Crash Data from 2017 to 2021. The primary objectives involve data visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, or Seaborn, examining trends and insights; building predictive models to identify variables contributing to crash severity, using techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree classification. The goal is to assist Transport for NSW in optimizing their campaign budget and implementing targeted interventions for road safety.
